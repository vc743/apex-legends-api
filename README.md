# Apex Legends Api Project

This is just a simple Apex Legends API that I built, I'm just starting to look at the backend stuff, so I apologize if I'm wrong with some of the instructions in this README file. Hope everything works correctly XD.

**Link to project:** https://apex-legends-api-hdoj.onrender.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Express

I used express to do all the server side stuff and I also used a bit of HTML just to show the url where you have to go to get the data.  <img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/vc743/apex-legends-api/assets/88216894/cd311cec-091c-4df1-973e-c5d52fefcaa5">
 

For the program to work on your PC you have to install express using: 

``` npm i express ```
## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to deal with get requests and I also learned how to deploy the project in Render.
